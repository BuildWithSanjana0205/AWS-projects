# üåê AWS Networking Series

Welcome to my **AWS Networking Series**!  

Over the course of **9 projects**, I built a complete Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from scratch. Each project took me one step closer to understanding how networking works in AWS ‚Äî from the basics of creating a VPC to securely connecting resources, monitoring traffic, and integrating with AWS services.

## üí° What I Achieved

By the end of this series, I:  
- Built a secure VPC architecture step by step  
- Connected resources across different environments  
- Applied network security and traffic control  
- Monitored and analyzed VPC traffic flow  
- Integrated AWS networking with storage services like S3  
- Documented everything with 9 portfolio-ready projects

## üìÇ Projects in this Series

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I built and learned in each project:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Build a Virtual Private Cloud](./01_Create_VPC)  
- I created the **foundation of my AWS network** by setting up a custom VPC.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [VPC Traffic Flow and Security](./02_VPC_Traffic_flow_and_security)  
- I explored how to **control traffic** with security groups and NACLs, keeping resources safe.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Creating a Private Subnet](./03_Create_Private_Subnet)  
- I learned to design **private subnets** to isolate workloads from public access.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Launching VPC Resources](./04_Launch_VPC_Resources)  
- I deployed EC2 instances inside my VPC, gaining experience in **launching and managing resources**.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [Testing VPC Connectivity](./05_Testing_VPC_Connectivity)  
- I verified how resources **communicate** within the VPC using connectivity tests.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ [VPC Peering](./06_VPC_Peering)  
- I connected **multiple VPCs together**, enabling cross-VPC communication.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ [VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs](./07_VPC_Monitoring)  
- I set up **Flow Logs** to track and analyze network traffic patterns.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ [Access S3 from a VPC](./08_Access_S3_from_a_VPC)  
- I integrated my VPC with **Amazon S3** to enable private access to cloud storage.  

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ [VPC Endpoints](./09_VPC_Endpoints)  
- I optimized connections to AWS services with **VPC endpoints**, improving security and efficiency.
