# 🏗️ Project 4: Load Data into DynamoDB

This project introduced me to **Amazon DynamoDB**, a fully managed NoSQL database service on AWS.  
I created tables, added items using both the **AWS Management Console** and **AWS CloudShell**, and explored key NoSQL concepts such as partition keys, attributes, and capacity units.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build DynamoDB tables from scratch and practice inserting items via both the AWS Console and AWS CloudShell.

---

## 🛠️ AWS Services Used

- **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **AWS CloudShell**
- **AWS CLI (within CloudShell)**

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

### 🔹 Create DynamoDB via Console
- Launched a new DynamoDB table using the AWS Management Console.  
- Defined **partition key** and item attributes.  
- Inserted sample items directly through the Console interface.  

### 🔹 Work with DynamoDB in CloudShell
- Opened **AWS CloudShell** for CLI-based access.  
- Created a DynamoDB table using CLI commands.  
- Inserted and updated items programmatically.  
- Handled unprocessed data scenarios.  

### 🔹 Explore Capacity Planning
- Used the **Capacity Calculator** to analyze read/write requirements.  
- Understood how inputs (item size, reads/sec, writes/sec, consistency type) affect **read capacity units (RCU)** and **write capacity units (WCU)**.  

---

## 📊 Outcome

- Successfully created and managed DynamoDB tables using both Console and CloudShell.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **NoSQL database modeling**.  
- Understood **when to use DynamoDB vs. relational databases**.
