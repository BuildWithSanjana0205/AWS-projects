# üöÄ AWS Database Series

Welcome to my **AWS Database Series**!  

Over the course of **5 projects**, I worked hands-on with both relational and NoSQL databases on AWS. This series gave me practical experience in building, connecting, and querying databases ‚Äî while also turning raw data into insights and visualizations.

## üí° What I Achieved

By the end of this series, I:  
- Built and connected multiple databases to applications  
- Queried data and visualized results to gain insights  
- Gained hands-on experience with **Relational (RDS, Aurora)** and **NoSQL (DynamoDB)** databases  
- Created 5 portfolio-ready projects that showcase my database and cloud skills

## üìÇ Projects in this Series

Here‚Äôs what I built and learned in each project:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Visualize a Relational Database](./01_Visualize_a_relational_database)  
- I created a **MySQL RDS database**, ran queries, and connected it with **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize insights.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Aurora Database with EC2](./02_Aurora_Database_with_EC2)  
- I set up an **Aurora database cluster** and connected it to an **EC2 instance**, learning how to securely manage database connectivity.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Connect a Web App with Aurora](./03_Connect_a_Web_App_with_Aurora)  
- I integrated a **web application** hosted on EC2 with **Aurora**, gaining practical experience in full-stack cloud development.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Load Data into DynamoDB](./04_Load_Data_into_DynamoDB)  
- I explored **DynamoDB**, AWS‚Äôs NoSQL database, by creating tables and loading data for high-performance storage.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [Query Data with DynamoDB](./05_Query_Data_with_DynamoDB)  
- I queried data using **DynamoDB Query & Scan operations**, learning how to retrieve and work with NoSQL data efficiently.
