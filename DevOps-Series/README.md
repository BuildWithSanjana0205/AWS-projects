🏗️ 6-Day DevOps Challenge

Welcome to the 6-Day DevOps Challenge! 🚀
Over the next 6 days, I built a complete CI/CD pipeline that takes code from commit → build → deployment, gaining practical DevOps skills highly valued in the tech & cloud industry.

By the end of this challenge, I had:

🛠️ Built a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools

🤖 Automated testing & deployment of a real application

📄 Created 6 portfolio-ready project docs to showcase my DevOps skills

📌 Challenge Roadmap
1️⃣ Project 1: Set Up a Web App in the Cloud

Launched an EC2 instance, deployed a Java web app.

🏗️ Final Architecture Diagram

Here is the end-to-end architecture of the CI/CD pipeline built during this challenge:

This diagram shows how code flows seamlessly from GitHub → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy → EC2 (with dependencies stored in CodeArtifact and artifacts in S3) — fully automated through CodePipeline.

🎯 Final Outcome

✅ Complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline built on AWS

✅ Automated build, test, and deployment process

✅ Portfolio showcasing hands-on DevOps projects
