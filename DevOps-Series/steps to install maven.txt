1️⃣ WSL preparation

Updated and installed WSL on Windows:

wsl --install


Launched Ubuntu WSL and created a default Unix user (tripa).

Opened VS Code, installed Remote - WSL extension, and opened a new WSL Ubuntu terminal in VS Code.

2️⃣ Initial Maven attempt

In the VS Code Ubuntu terminal, ran:

wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.5.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.2-bin.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf apache-maven-3.5.2-bin.tar.gz -C /opt
echo "export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.5.2/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


Errors encountered:

utime(...): Operation not permitted → due to downloading in /mnt/c/...

Bash errors: not a valid identifier → caused by Windows PATH containing spaces

JAVA_HOME not defined → Maven requires JDK

3️⃣ Troubleshooting steps

Confirmed WSL Ubuntu terminal worked

Ran wsl -d Ubuntu outside VS Code to ensure Bash shell was functional.

Cleaned up PATH issues

Removed broken PATH lines from ~/.bashrc.

Added Maven to PATH safely with quotes:

echo 'export PATH="/opt/apache-maven-3.5.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc


Installed Java JDK in WSL

Checked Java: java -version → not found

Installed OpenJDK 21:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-21-jdk


Set JAVA_HOME and updated PATH:

echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:/opt/apache-maven-3.5.2/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


Verified Maven installation

mvn -v


Confirmed Maven 3.5.2 installed

Java 21 detected

Correct Maven and Java home directories
